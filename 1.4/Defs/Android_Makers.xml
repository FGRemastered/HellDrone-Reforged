		<description>An uninitialized Hell Unit android. The hell unit is a specialized android that far surpasses even the most enhanced human thanks to its incredibly efficient AI and utilities. This AI has tweaked moral parameters, increasing rationality and reducing emotions in both combat and non-combat scenarios. An internal reward system was added for task completion - be it death-dealing or kitchen construction - to encourage certain behaviors.</description>
